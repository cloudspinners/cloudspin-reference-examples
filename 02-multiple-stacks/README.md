This code example creates an AWS VPC and a set of public and private subnets.

It is based on the [infrablocks base networking module](https://github.com/infrablocks/terraform-aws-base-networking), although I've stripped it down to the point where it's not really usable - no routing or gateways in or out.

See the [cloudspin reference](https://github.com/cloudspinners/cloudspin-reference) for information on setting up and using this.
